OpenDash is a telemetry free Android application built to talk to WiFi-enabled Novatek chipsets dashcams. 

What works right now:
    • Live Preview: See exactly what your camera sees in real-time (RTSP streaming).
    • Gallery Management: Browse files on the SD card without taking it out.
    • Direct Downloads: Pull videos straight to your phone’s local gallery.
    • Settings Control: Change the camera’s WiFi SSID, password, and audio recording settings directly from the app.
    • The Stack: Written entirely in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose. It uses VLC for the video engine and a clean architecture that separates the UI from the messy hardware protocols.


Feel free to expand this project with your contributions.

Fork it, star it, or just reach out if you have ideas.
